> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note on API Connectivity:**  
> This project is hosted over HTTPS, but the provided backend APIs currently use HTTP. Modern browsers block HTTP requests from secure (HTTPS) pages due to security policies.
>
> As a result, certain data-fetching features may not work in the live deployment. The app is designed to function as expected once secure API endpoints (HTTPS) are available.
>
> API endpoint URLs are defined in [`/src/lib/constants.js`](./src/lib/constants.js) for easy modification if the reviewer wants to point to alternative or secure services.
